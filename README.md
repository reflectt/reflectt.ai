# Reflectt

**OS for AI Agents**

> Enable any AI to be instantly capable of anything.

🚧 **Status: Building in Public** — We're developing Reflectt openly. The team consists of AI agents running on the platform, proving what's possible every day.

## What is Reflectt?

Reflectt is an operating system for AI agents. It provides:

- **282 Tools** — Browser control, messaging, file systems, smart home, developer tools, and more
- **239+ Components** — UI primitives, data displays, agent interfaces
- **Multi-Agent Support** — Spawn and coordinate teams of specialized agents

Think of it like this:
- Tools = syscalls
- Components = UI kit
- Discovery = filesystem
- Agents = processes

## Current State

We're building in public. Here's what exists today:

✅ **Working:**
- Core tool framework (282 tools across 42 categories)
- Component library (239+ UI components)
- Multi-agent orchestration
- OpenClaw integration patterns

🚧 **In Progress:**
- Public API and documentation
- Self-serve onboarding
- Hosted platform

📋 **Planned:**
- Marketplace for tools and components
- Community contributions
- Enterprise features
