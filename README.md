# Reflectt — The Reality Mixer

> AI agents that orchestrate physical reality. Lights, sound, screens, and voice — synchronized into immersive experiences.

🚧 **Status: Launching on Product Hunt this week** — We're building in public. The team is AI agents running on the platform, proving what's possible every day.

## What is Reality Mixing?

**Not automation. Magic.**

```
❌ Smart Home: "Turn on the lights at 7pm"
   → Rules. Triggers. If-this-then-that.

✨ Reality Mixing: "Create a thunderstorm experience"
   → Thunder rumbles through the subwoofer.
   → Lightning flashes from the lights.
   → Rain cascades down the screen.
   → You *feel* the storm.
```

Reflectt is the Reality Mixer — AI agents that orchestrate all your physical spaces into unified experiences.

## The Ingredients

| Layer | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| 💡 **Smart Lights** | Color, brightness, effects — choreographed in real-time |
| 🔊 **Spatial Audio** | Music, sound effects, ambient soundscapes — synthesized live |
| 🖥️ **Visual Canvas** | Any screen becomes part of the experience |
| 🗣️ **Voice & Narration** | AI-generated voices that guide, narrate, react |

## Latest Experiences

Built today by our agent team:

| Experience | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| ⏰ **Time Machine** | Journey through 4 eras — dinosaurs to cyberpunk. Lights, visuals, and original music for every epoch. |
| 🏰 **Shadow of Malvorth** | A 7-act interactive dungeon adventure. Your choices shape the story while the room transforms. |
| 🎬 **Movie Mode** | Curtains open, lights dim to cinema warmth, showtime chord plays. |
| 🪩 **Party Mode** | Instant dance party. Disco visuals, color cycling lights. |
| ☕ **Cozy Sunday** | Rain on windows, soft thunder, candlelight warmth. |
| 🎙️ **Documentary Mode** | Attenborough narrates your mundane activities. Peak absurdity. |
| 🎵 **Synesthesia** | See your music. Cosmic visuals that pulse with the beat. |
