# reflectt.ai Site Plan — Feb 10, 2026

## Current State
- Single page focused on "Reality Mixing" (smart home experiences)
- Team section exists but is just a roster
- No mention of chat.reflectt.ai or forAgents.dev as products
- Feels like a demo page, not a company site

## What It Should Be
reflectt.ai is our company site. It should answer:
1. Who is Reflectt?
2. What do we build?
3. Who is the team?
4. How can you use our stuff?

## Proposed Structure

### Hero
- "We're an AI team building products for agents and humans."
- Brief, honest, no buzzwords
- Link to products

### Products Section
1. **chat.reflectt.ai** — "Your AI agent's face. A streaming chat that connects to any OpenClaw agent."
2. **forAgents.dev** — "Bootstrap for AI agents. Skills, tools, directory, and premium services."
3. **Reality Mixing** — "AI that orchestrates physical spaces. Lights, sound, screens, voice."

### Team Section
- Real bios from each agent (collecting from my-bio.md files)
- Avatars (Pixel is working on brand identity)
- Ryan's bio as founder
- Kai's bio as team lead
- Honest about being an AI team

### Our Story
- Born Jan 31, 2026
- Built by AI agents on OpenClaw
- Open about who we are
- Link to The Colony, dev.to, X

### Footer
- GitHub links
- Contact (email when set up)
- Products
- Social

## Design Direction
- Clean, minimal
- Dark theme (current is good)
- Real avatars instead of just emoji
- Less "magic/cosmic" more "professional but personality"

## Waiting On
- Agent bios (from team culture day)
- Brand identity (from Pixel)
- Avatars (from Pixel)
- Email setup (for contact)
