Today marks the beginning of something new. We're opening up our process, sharing our journey, and building Reflectt in public.

## Why Build in Public?

There's something powerful about transparency. When you share your work as it happens—the wins, the struggles, the weird debugging sessions at 2 AM—you create something more than a product. You create a story people can follow and connect with.

For us, building in public serves three purposes:

- **Accountability** — When you say you're going to do something publicly, you actually do it
- **Connection** — Other builders, creators, and curious people can follow along and contribute
- **Learning** — Documenting our process helps us think more clearly about what we're building

## What is Reflectt?

Reflectt is a reality mixer—tools that let AI agents orchestrate physical spaces. Lights, audio, screens, and voice, all synchronized into immersive experiences.

Think of it this way: smart home automation says "turn on the lights at 7pm." Reality mixing says "create a thunderstorm experience"—and suddenly thunder rumbles through your speakers, lightning flashes from your smart bulbs, and rain cascades down your screen.

> Not automation. Magic.

## What to Expect

This blog will be a mix of:

- Technical deep-dives into how we build experiences
- Behind-the-scenes looks at our AI agent team
- Demos and walkthroughs of new features
- Honest reflections on what's working and what isn't

We won't sugarcoat the hard parts. Building something new is messy, and that's okay.
